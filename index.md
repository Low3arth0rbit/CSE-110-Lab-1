## Intro
I am a third year UCSD student, studying *Computer Engineering*. I have been programming since high school. I used to be part of my high school robotics team, 
[***Team 599, Robodox***](https://therobodox.org/). This is where I picked up C++ programming language. 

If there is one thing I learned from high school programming is something my mentor always talked about:
> Before relying on libraries, try to understand what it does first.

This was especially true with robotics because many of control system(path finding, motion PID, etc.) were preprogrammed into libraries and it was as simple as settinng your system, or motors, to the desired speed like: `motor->set(velocity = x)`. Now in my programming journey, I always try to dive deeper into the libraries or premade functions to understand the steps they are taking to achieve its goal.

## Skills
Here are some programming languages I picked up over the years:
- C++
- C
- Java
- SystemVerilog
- Python
- Arduino

## Things I like to do
While I like all these activities, this is a good representation of what I like the most:
1. **Sports with friends** (no particular order for specific sports)
   - [Surfing(I just got into surfing and it is so fun)](Pictures/surf.jpg)
   - Soccer(Favorite sports to play with friends)
   - [Hiking](Pictures/hike.jpg)
   - Tennis
   - Gym
   - Bowling
   - And many more :D
2. Going out with friends, where ever it may be
3. Playing video games
4. Cooking/Baking

## Some of the things I wanted to accomplish in UCSD
- [x] learn to surf
- [ ] make some major friends
- [x] join a community
- [x] make friends who are willing to do things together with me
- [x] spend at least once a week playing sports
